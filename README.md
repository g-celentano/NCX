# Sor't
A Swift Playground project that explains how some of the existing sorting algorithms work on an array( of integers in this case).

## Sorting algorithms present in the application
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort

### What does the application do?
Other than showing the sorting of the array, the app tells also the Big-O Notation of that particular algorithm, with also how much time it took to execute (only supported on iOS>16).
